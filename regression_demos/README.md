# Regression Models Using Numpy Operations

This project was apart of a group school project for object oriented program class 
at BI Norwegian Business School. The instructions given from the instructors are fairly similar 
to Sci-Kit-Leanrs program, with some exceptions such as optimize method is being used instead of
fit method that sklearn has.

This was a group project which consisted of Ole Anders Bolle, Duc Binh Minh, and myself.
