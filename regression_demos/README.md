# Regression Models Using Numpy Operations

This project was apart of a group school project for object oriented program class 
at BI Norwegian Business School. The instructions given from the instructors are fairly similar 
to Sci-Kit-Leanrs program, with some exceptions such as optimize method is being used instead of
fit method that sklearn has.

Much credit should also be delegated to Ole Anders Bolle, and Duc Binh Minh.
