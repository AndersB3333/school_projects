# Conformal Prediction for Binary Classification: Credit Card Churn Prediction

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Transductive Conformal Prediction (TCP) in binary classification, applied to a real-world problem: predicting customer churn in the credit card industry. Conformal prediction is a powerful framework that complements traditional machine learning models by providing valid, well-calibrated prediction intervals or sets, ensuring a predefined level of confidence in the model’s predictions. This project is part of my portfolio and is designed to showcase the benefits and practical applications of conformal prediction in binary classification tasks.

## What is Conformal Prediction?

Conformal prediction is a statistical framework that wraps around a standard machine learning algorithm, converting point predictions into prediction sets or intervals. It ensures that, under minimal assumptions, the coverage probability (the probability that the true label is included in the prediction set) is guaranteed to be close to a user-defined confidence level. This method can be applied in both classification and regression problems.

In the context of binary classification, conformal prediction outputs a prediction set, which may include one or both classes, depending on the uncertainty of the prediction. It provides not just a prediction but also a measure of how confident the model is in that prediction, making it a valuable tool for decision-making in high-stakes applications.

## Benefits of Conformal Prediction

### 1. **Validity and Calibration**
   Conformal prediction offers guarantees that the prediction intervals or sets contain the true outcome with a specified probability (e.g., 95%). This holds true under any distribution of the data, making the method highly robust.

### 2. **Flexibility**
   Conformal prediction can be applied to any machine learning model, from decision trees and support vector machines to deep neural networks. It works as a post-processing step, meaning it does not require retraining the model and can be used with any off-the-shelf algorithm.

### 3. **Practical Uncertainty Quantification**
   In standard classification problems, predictions are often given without any measure of uncertainty. Conformal prediction, however, quantifies uncertainty by providing prediction sets, which give decision-makers more context. In cases of high uncertainty, the method can return multiple labels, highlighting the need for further investigation.

### 4. **Model-Agnostic**
   As a model-agnostic framework, conformal prediction can be used with both simple and complex models. This means that it can be easily integrated into existing machine learning pipelines, without needing to overhaul the underlying models.

### 5. **Control Over Error Rate**
   A key benefit is the ability to control the error rate. By setting the desired confidence level (e.g., 95% or 99%), you can control the proportion of incorrect predictions, ensuring that your model’s decisions are more reliable. This is particularly useful in sensitive domains like credit card churn prediction, where incorrect predictions can lead to significant financial losses.

### 6. **Improved Decision-Making**
   By providing a range of possible outcomes, conformal prediction enhances decision-making processes. When uncertainty is high, stakeholders can choose to gather more information or take conservative actions. This is especially important in applications like credit card churn prediction, where high confidence predictions can help retain valuable customers.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preprocessing:** This step includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and splitting the dataset into training and test sets.
- **Model Training:** A baseline binary classification model is trained using common algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
- **Conformal Prediction Application:** TCP is applied to the model to generate prediction sets for customer churn.
- **Evaluation:** The performance of the model with and without TCP is compared, focusing on the accuracy of predictions and the calibration of prediction sets.
